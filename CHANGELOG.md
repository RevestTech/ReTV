## [2.5.2] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- **Black screen on iOS Safari (iPhone)**: Removed `height: -webkit-fill-available` from `#root` which computed to 0 on certain iOS Safari versions, clipping all content. Replaced with standard `100vh` + `100dvh` fallback
- **Stale HTML cached on mobile**: Nginx `Cache-Control: no-cache` only applied to `location = /index.html` but not when served via `try_files` fallback from `location /`. Added aggressive no-cache headers (`no-store, must-revalidate`) to the catch-all location block
- **External scripts blocking iOS rendering**: Made Chromecast SDK and Google IMA SDK scripts `async defer` to prevent parser-blocking on iOS Safari
- **CSS `dvh` units without fallback**: Added `vh` fallbacks before all `dvh` declarations in sidebar and modal mobile styles

### Added
- Inline loading fallback ("Loading Adajoon...") in `index.html` visible until React mounts
- Inline `window.onerror` handler that displays JavaScript errors visually for debugging
- Server-side non-www to www redirect in nginx config (`return 301`)

## [2.5.1] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- **502 Bad Gateway on all API calls**: Frontend nginx proxy was defaulting to port 8000 but Railway runs the backend on port 8080. Updated `frontend/start.sh` default `BACKEND_URL` from `http://backend:8000` to `http://backend.railway.internal:8080`
- **Nginx proxy template**: Added `proxy_connect_timeout 10s` to `/api/` location block in `nginx.conf.template` for better error handling

### Changed
- **Railway service cleanup**: Renamed frontend service from "Adajoon" back to "frontend" for consistency with codebase conventions
- **Backend CORS origins**: Added `https://adajoon-production.up.railway.app` to `CORS_ORIGINS` and `WEBAUTHN_ORIGIN` environment variables

### Removed
- Deleted orphaned "frontend" service (had failed deployment from earlier rebuild)
- Deleted accidental "function-bun" service (created by Railway Agent intercepting keyboard input)
