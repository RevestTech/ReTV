## Overview

### What is a Skill System?

A comprehensive skill system provides AI assistants with project-specific coding patterns, conventions, and best practices. It ensures consistency across the codebase and prevents common mistakes.

### Three-Tier Architecture

```

    ↓        ↓        ↓        ↓
.cursorrules CLAUDE.md Agent  README
(concise)   (detailed) (auto) (docs)
```

### Benefits

- ✅ **Consistency**: All code follows same patterns
- ✅ **Quality**: Enforces best practices automatically
- ✅ **Speed**: Quick reference instead of searching docs
- ✅ **Learning**: Captures institutional knowledge
- ✅ **Evolution**: Continuous improvement process

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

1. **Codebase Access**: Read access to all project files
2. **Git Repository**: Version control for tracking changes
3. **Project Understanding**: Know the tech stack and architecture
4. **Time**: Allow 2-4 hours for initial skill creation

---

## Phase 1: Analyze the Codebase

### Step 1.1: Identify Technology Areas

Create a list of distinct technical areas in the project. Common areas include:

- **Backend/API** (e.g., FastAPI, Django, Express)
- **Frontend** (e.g., React, Vue, Angular)
- **Database** (e.g., SQLAlchemy, Prisma, Mongoose)
- **Security** (authentication, authorization, input validation)
- **Deployment** (Docker, CI/CD, cloud platforms)
- **Testing** (unit tests, integration tests)
- **Code Quality** (conventions, naming, formatting)

**Example for a typical full-stack app:**
```
1. Backend API patterns
2. Frontend component patterns
3. Database models and migrations
4. Security and authentication
5. Deployment and infrastructure
6. Code conventions
```

### Step 1.2: Analyze Each Area

For each technical area, examine:

**Files to Review:**
```bash
# Backend
find backend/ -name "*.py" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts" | head -20

# Frontend
find frontend/src -name "*.jsx" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.vue" | head -20

# Config
find . -name "Dockerfile" -o -name "docker-compose.yml" -o -name ".env.example"
```

**Patterns to Extract:**
- ✅ File structure and organization
- ✅ Naming conventions (files, functions, variables)
- ✅ Import patterns
- ✅ Error handling approaches
- ✅ Authentication/authorization patterns
- ✅ Database query patterns
- ✅ API endpoint structure
- ✅ Testing patterns
- ✅ Deployment configurations

### Step 1.3: Create Skill List

Based on your analysis, create a prioritized list of skills to create:

**Priority 1 (Core Patterns):**
1. Backend/API skill
2. Frontend skill
3. Security skill

**Priority 2 (Infrastructure):**
4. Database skill
5. Deployment skill

**Priority 3 (Quality):**
6. Code conventions skill
7. Continuous improvement meta-skill

---

## Phase 2: Create Individual Skills

### Step 2.1: Set Up Directory Structure

Create the skills directory:

```bash
mkdir -p .cursor/skills
```

### Step 2.2: Create Each Skill File

For each skill area, create a comprehensive SKILL.md file.

**Directory naming convention:**
```
.cursor/skills/<project-name>-<area>/SKILL.md
```

**Example:**
```
.cursor/skills/myapp-backend/SKILL.md
.cursor/skills/myapp-frontend/SKILL.md
.cursor/skills/myapp-security/SKILL.md
```

### Step 2.3: Skill File Template

Use this template for each SKILL.md file:

```markdown
# [Project Name] [Area] Patterns

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: [Date]  
**Skill Type**: [Backend/Frontend/Security/etc.]  
**Auto-triggers**: When working with [file patterns]

## Phase 4: Add Continuous Improvement

Create a meta-skill for evolving the skill system over time.

### Step 4.1: Create Skill Improvement Skill

**File: `.cursor/skills/<project>-skill-improvement/SKILL.md`**

Use the Karpathy-style learning methodology:

```markdown
# [Project Name] Skill Improvement Process

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Based on**: Andrej Karpathy's iterative learning methodology

## Overview

This skill describes how to continuously improve all project skills
based on real-world feedback, incidents, and learnings.

---

## 1. Iterative Refinement

### Track What Works vs What Doesn't

**Daily Observations:**
Keep a quick notes file: `.cursor/skills/<project>-skill-improvement/logs/quick-notes.txt`

```txt
YYYY-MM-DD: ✅ Pattern worked well: [description]
YYYY-MM-DD: ⚠️ Pattern violated: [description]
YYYY-MM-DD: 💡 New pattern emerged: [description]
```

### Log Deviations

When skills are violated, document in:
`.cursor/skills/<project>-skill-improvement/logs/deviations.md`

**Format:**
```markdown
## [Date] - [Skill] - [Pattern Violated]

**What happened**: [description]
**Why it happened**: [root cause]
**Impact**: [severity: low/medium/high]
**Action**: [update skill / clarify pattern / acceptable exception]
```

---

## 2. Learning by Doing

### Document Incidents

When bugs occur or incidents happen, document the learning:

**File**: `.cursor/skills/<project>-skill-improvement/learnings/YYYY-MM-DD-short-description.md`

**Template:**
```markdown
# Learning: [Short Title]

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Severity**: [Low/Medium/High/Critical]  
**Time to Resolution**: [minutes/hours]

## What Happened
[Description of the incident]

## Why It Happened
[Root cause analysis]

## The Fix
[What was done to resolve]

## Prevention Strategy
[How to prevent recurrence]

### Skill Updates Required
- [ ] Update [skill-name] v[X.Y.Z] → v[X.Y.Z+1]
- [ ] Add section on [topic]
- [ ] Update checklist

## Metrics
- Detection time: [time]
- Resolution time: [time]
- Recurrence risk: [low/medium/high]

## Related Skills
- [skill link]
```

---

## 3. Self-Review Process

### Before Committing (Daily)
- [ ] Does code follow all applicable skill patterns?
- [ ] Are there any skill violations?
- [ ] Should any new patterns be documented?

### Weekly Review (Fridays, 15 minutes)

**Template**: `.cursor/skills/<project>-skill-improvement/reviews/weekly-template.md`

```markdown
# Weekly Skill Review - [Date]

## Patterns That Worked Well
- Pattern 1
- Pattern 2

## Patterns Violated (from quick notes)
- Violation 1 → [update skill / clarify / acceptable]
- Violation 2 → [action]

## New Patterns Observed
- Pattern 1 → [add to skill]
- Pattern 2 → [document next week]

## Skill Updates This Week
- [skill-name] v[X.Y.Z] → v[X.Y.Z+1]: [change]

## Action Items
- [ ] Item 1
- [ ] Item 2
```

### Monthly Audit (30 minutes)

**Template**: `.cursor/skills/<project>-skill-improvement/audits/monthly-template.md`

```markdown
# Monthly Skill Audit - [Month Year]

- [ ] [skill-name]: [planned change]

## Meta-Learning
What did we learn about the skill system itself?
- Learning 1
- Learning 2
```

---

## 4. Feedback Loops

### Code Review Comments → Skill Updates

When reviewers repeatedly mention the same issue:

**Process:**
1. Tag comment with `[SKILL:skill-name]`
2. After 3rd occurrence, update skill
3. Version bump and document in changelog

**Example:**
```markdown
# Code Review
[SKILL:backend] Missing input validation on user_id parameter.
See "Input Validation" section in backend skill.
```

### Bug Fixes → Pattern Documentation

**Process:**
1. Fix bug
2. Document in `learnings/`
3. Update relevant skill within 24 hours
4. Add to prevention checklist

### Performance Issues → Best Practices

When performance issues occur:
1. Document the issue and fix
2. Add performance pattern to relevant skill
3. Update "Anti-Patterns" section

---

## 5. Skill Evolution

### Versioning

Use semantic versioning for skills:

- **MAJOR** (v1 → v2): Breaking change in pattern
- **MINOR** (v1.0 → v1.1): New pattern added
- **PATCH** (v1.0.0 → v1.0.1): Clarification or fix

**Format:**
```markdown
# [Project] [Area] Patterns

**Version**: 1.2.3
**Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD

## Changelog
- v1.2.3 (YYYY-MM-DD): Fixed typo in example
- v1.2.0 (YYYY-MM-DD): Added async/await pattern
- v1.1.0 (YYYY-MM-DD): Added caching section
- v1.0.0 (YYYY-MM-DD): Initial version
```

### Deprecation Process

When deprecating a pattern:

1. **v[X.Y.0]**: Mark as deprecated, show alternative
```markdown
## Pattern X (DEPRECATED)

⚠️ **Deprecated in v1.5.0. Use Pattern Y instead.**

Old pattern still works but will be removed in v2.0.0.

**Migration guide**: [link]
```

2. **v[X+1.0.0]**: Remove deprecated pattern

---

## 6. Meta-Learning

### Questions to Ask Monthly

1. **Which skills are most violated?**
   - Needs clarification?
   - Too strict?
   - Not practical?

2. **Which skills prevent most bugs?**
   - High ROI
   - Should be emphasized
   - Should expand coverage

3. **Which skills need clarification?**
   - Repeated questions
   - Multiple interpretations
   - Add examples

4. **What's missing from skills?**
   - Gaps in coverage
   - New patterns emerging
   - Technology changes

### Success Metrics

**Skill System Health:**
- ✅ Weekly reviews completed: [%]
- ✅ Skills updated after incidents: [response time]
- ✅ Team engagement: [high/medium/low]

**Code Quality Impact:**
- ✅ Bug recurrence rate: [%]
- ✅ Code review iterations: [avg]
- ✅ Time to onboard new developers: [days]

**ROI:**
```
Monthly ROI = (Bugs Prevented × Fix Time) / Skill Maintenance Time
Example: (10 bugs × 2 hours) / (4 hours review + 2 hours updates)
       = 20 hours / 6 hours
       = 3.3x return on investment
```

## Philosophy (Karpathy-Style)

1. **Learn by doing** - Skills improve through real implementation
2. **Track everything** - What works, what doesn't, why
3. **Iterate fast** - Small frequent updates beat large rewrites
4. **Build understanding** - Document the why, not just the what
5. **Test assumptions** - Validate patterns with real code

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Too Generic
❌ "Use best practices for authentication"  
✅ "Use cookie-based JWT with httponly, secure, SameSite=Lax attributes. Store in auth_token cookie. Read using get_current_user(token: str = Cookie(None)) dependency."

### 2. No Examples
❌ Just describing patterns in prose  
✅ Include 3-5 real code examples from the actual codebase

### 3. Too Long
❌ 1000+ line skill files that nobody reads  
✅ 300-600 lines with good organization and searchable headings

### 4. Isolated Skills
❌ Skills that don't reference each other  
✅ Cross-reference related skills, show how they work together

### 5. No Maintenance
❌ Create once and never update  
✅ Weekly quick notes, monthly audits, update after incidents

### 6. Wrong Level of Detail
❌ Either too high-level or too low-level

## FAQ

### Q: How long does it take to create skills?

**A:** Initial creation: 2-4 hours using parallel agents. Ongoing maintenance: 15 min/week + 30 min/month.

### Q: What if our codebase is inconsistent?

**A:** Document the *intended* patterns, not existing inconsistencies. Use skills to drive consistency improvements over time.

### Q: Should we include third-party library patterns?

**A:** Only if you have project-specific conventions for using them. Example: "Always use authenticatedFetch for mutations" (your utility) vs "Use fetch API" (generic).

### Q: How do we handle deprecated patterns?

**A:** Mark as deprecated in skill, provide migration path, remove in next major version. See deprecation process in skill-improvement skill.

### Q: What if team members disagree on patterns?

**A:** Document the decided pattern, note the tradeoff, and track if it works in practice. Update if evidence shows a better approach.

### Q: Do we need all 7 skill types?

**A:** Start with 3-4 core skills (backend, frontend, security, conventions). Add others as needed. The skill-improvement meta-skill is always valuable.

### Q: How do we measure ROI?

**A:** Track bugs prevented by skills (estimate based on code reviews). Calculate: `(Bugs Prevented × Avg Fix Time) / Time Invested in Skills`. Target: >2x return.

## Support

If you have questions while implementing this for your project:
1. Reference the Adajoon implementation as an example
2. Start small (3 skills) and expand
3. Focus on patterns that prevent real bugs, not theoretical best practices
4. Iterate based on team feedback

**Remember**: Skills are living documents. Start with good-enough skills and improve them based on real-world use. Perfect is the enemy of done.
